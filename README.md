### WHAT I LEARNED



*Over my time of redoing I learned flex box is really valuable and I saw all the downsides of my previous 

attempt with percentages. 

*Getting my flickity to work was really great and got me understanding how to import plug-ins work and gave me

taught me plug-ins are nothing but other peoples code. 

*Adding the email validator was taught me every site I design should have this, because if I were to send out newsletters

I'd only want to real emails. And after learning more about JS with selectors and event handlers before redoing my project,

putting my Jquery object/button to be pressed made was easier than I expected

*I understand flex-wrap a lot more after working on it alot to make my navigation collapse to the top when hitting tablet 

version. Setting a specific width and dropping that width when hitting the tablet breakpoint 

took a long time to figure out and was worth the time to perfect.

*Another personal learning I got from this was is google is your best friend, but after struggling trying to get something to 

work. Copy and pasting the JavaScript email validation and breaking it down and learning how it works, got me to 
understand not only how it works, but the parts that build it. 

*Flex-basis helped out alot of well, only taking up a certain length of the screen, giving my pictures a scalable look. 

*I learned to follow the media queries given to me and not to try to make my own.

*Using justify-content to push items to the start and end of page really helped out alot.

*Finally, I learned organized code helps out alot, it really shows you who is the parent and child of something,
and even organizing brackets in JavaScript makes a real difference, by making it clear which bracket belongs with

what function.
