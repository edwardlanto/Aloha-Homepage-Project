##WHAT I LEARNED



* Over my time of redoing I learned flex box is really valuable and I saw all the downsides of my previous attempt with

percentages. 

* Getting my flickity to work was really great and got me understanding how to import plug-ins work and gave me
taught me plug-ins are nothing, but other peoples code. 

* Adding the email validator was taught me every site I design should have this, because if I were to send out newsletters

I'd only want to real emails. And after learning more about JS with selectors and event handlers before redoing my project,

putting my Jquery object/button to be pressed made was easier than I expected

* I understand flex-wrap a lot more after working on it alot to make my navigation collapse

to the top when hitting tablet version. Setting a specific width and dropping that 

width when hitting the tablet breakpoint took a long time to figure out, and was worth the time to perfect.

* Another personal learning I got from this was is google is your best friend, but after struggling trying to get something to work. 

Copy and pasting the JavaScript email validation and breaking it down and learning how it works, got me to 

understand not only how it works, but the parts that build it. 

* Flex-basis helped out alot of well, only taking up a certain length of the screen, giving my pictures a scalable look. 

Also the comment I got on my first hand in, to take off the extra media query made perfect sense, and I learned to follow only breakpoints given to me. 

* Flex box was golden to me during this project, moving items to the end of the page eg. cart or having the option to move it to the start.

* Finally, I learned organized code helps out alot, it really shows you who is the parent and child of something,

and even organizing brackets in JavaScript makes a real difference, by making it clear which bracket belongs with

what function.
