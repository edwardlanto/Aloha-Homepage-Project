# ALOHA PROJECT

## Languages used = HTML, CSS & Javascript


## This is a responsive web design of the Aloha sketch provided to us. It works on all browers and all screen resolutions.


## Aloha is a modern, clothing website with a sleek design a great functionality




* Flexbox is really valuable and has given me the ability to move images and text at the start , center or end of a page perfectly.

* Using max-width to tell an item that it should not go past a certain width was helpful, especially using media queries where I would want content to stay the same size, no matter how big the screen gets.

* Getting my flickity to work was really great and gave me an understanding of how to import plugins work and was a good teaching for show me how to implement other peoples code with my own.

* Adding the email validator has taught me every site I design should have this, because if I were to send out monthly newsletters I'd only want to valid emails to have the ability to receive.

* Regex AKA regular expressions are really powerful and can filter anything I want out of a of a string.

* I understand flex-wrap a lot more now, after utilizing it on my main navigation to collapse at the top of the best when the extending the width of the screen. It's a property that has alot of flexibility and use cases, especially at media query breakpoints.

* Flex-basis helped out alot of well, only taking up a certain length of the screen, giving my pictures a scalable look. 

* Using justify-content along with aligns items to perfectly center an item.

* Using jQuery to create my first function was really fun ! I learned how to store a value in an input and manipulate that value by clicking a button. Alongside that I learned how to make input values readable only so others can not edit the text area.

* Finally, I learned organized code is necessary, it really shows you which child belongs to which parent, and even organizing brackets in JavaScript makes a real difference, by making it clear which bracket belongs with what function.
