WHAT I LEARNED

    DURING MY RESUBMIT OF ALOHA P2, I LEARNED FLEX BOX IS REALLY VALUABLE AND I SAW ALL THE DOWNSIDES OF MY PREVIOUS ATTEMPT WITH

PERCENTAGES. GETTING MY FLICKITY TO WORK WAS REALLY GREAT AND GOT ME UNDERSTANDING HOW TO IMPORT PLUG-INS AND ATTACH MY 

PRODUCT ITEMS TO THEM. ADDING THE EMAIL VALIDATOR WAS COOL ALSO, WITH PRIOR KNOWLEDGE OF USING JS WITH SELECTORS AND EVENT HANDLERS,

PUTTING THE CODE IN WAS EASIER THAN EXPECTED. I UNDERSTAND FLEX-WRAP ALOT MORE AFTER WORKING ON IT ALOT TO MAKE MY NAVIGATION COLLAPSE

TO THE TOP WHEN HITTING TABLET VERSION. SETTING A SPECIFIC WIDTH AND DROPPING THAT WIDTH WHEN HITTING THE TABLET BREAKPOINT TOOK

A LONG TIME TO FIGURE OUT, BUT ILL REMEMEMBER THE CONCEPT BECAUSE OF THAT STRUGGLE. ANOTHER PERSONAL LEARNING I GOT FROM THIS WAS IS

GOOGLE IS YOUR BEST FRIEND, BUT AFTER STRUGGLING TRYING TO GET SOMETHING TO WORK. COPY AND PASTING THE JAVASCRIPT EMAIL VALIDATION

AND BREAKING IT DOWN AND LEARNING HOW IT WORKS, GOT ME TO UNDERSTAND NOT ONLY HOW IT WORKS, BUT THE PARTS THAT BUILD IT. FLEX-BASIS HELPED

OUT ALOT OF WELL, ONLY TAKING UP A CERTAIN LENGTH OF THE SCREEN, GIVING MY PICTURES A SCALABLE LOOK. AND THE COMMENT I GOT ON MY FIRST

HAND IN, TO TAKE OFF THE EXTRA MEDIA QUERY MADE PERFECT SENSE, AND I LEARNED TO FOLLOW ONLY BREAKPOINTS GIVEN TO ME. FLEX BOX WAS 

GOLDEN TO ME DURING THIS PROJECT, MOVING ITEMS TO THE END OF THE PAGE EG. CART OR HAVING THE OPTION TO MOVE IT TO THE START.
